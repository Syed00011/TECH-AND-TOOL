    <h2> You Can Create a Folder Without a Name in Windows</h2>
    <p>There's a trick to create a folder without a name and hide it!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, rename the folder and press <strong>Alt + 0160</strong> or <strong>Alt + 255</strong> to make the folder name blank.</li>
        <li>Then, right-click the folder, go to <strong>Properties</strong> → <strong>Customize</strong> → <strong>Change Icon</strong>, and select an invisible icon.</li>

    <h2>When You Download Something, Your Device Gets Heavier!</h2>
    <p>Every piece of data you download or store adds a minuscule amount of weight to your device! Data is made up of electrons, which have mass. While it’s hard to notice, the entire internet is estimated to weigh about 50 grams—roughly the weight of a small grapefruit. So, each time you download, you're technically adding a tiny bit of weight!</p>

	<!-- Fact about Light Switch and Computers -->
<div class="article">
    <h2>Did You Know? A Light Switch is Like a Simple Computer?</h2>
    <p>A light switch operates in a similar way to a computer. Just like a switch can turn a light on (1) or off (0), computers use binary code to process information. This means every task a computer performs is based on simple on/off signals, just like flipping a light switch!</p>
    <p>If you were to assemble individual switches to create a computer, it would take you a room full of switches just to perform basic tasks! Each switch represents a tiny part of the complex computations happening inside your computer.</p>

<!-- Fact about Naming Folders -->
<div class="article">
    <h2>Did You Know? You Can't Create a Folder Named "CON"?</h2>
    <p>In Windows, certain reserved names, like "CON," "PRN," "AUX," and "NUL," cannot be used for folders or files. This is because these names are reserved for specific system devices. So if you try to create a folder with the name "CON," you'll get an error!</p>
